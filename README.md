# NormalFormCalculator

Write a program in Java to do the following.


For a given Relation (Table) with given attributes and set of FDs, identify the keys and check the highest normal form it satisfies. 
If the highest NF is x then suggest appropriate decomposition to take it to the (x+1) NF. 
Also identify the keys for the decomposed relations.
Test for losslessness and Dependency preservancy not required here.
Only up to BCNF NF.
